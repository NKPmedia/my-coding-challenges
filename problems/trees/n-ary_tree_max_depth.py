Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree

Reference: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal,
each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

Example:
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: 3

Solution: Breath First Search
Time Complexity: O(n)
