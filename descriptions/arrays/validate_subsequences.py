Validate Subsequences

Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines
whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

A Subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that are either in the array but
that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the
numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4].
