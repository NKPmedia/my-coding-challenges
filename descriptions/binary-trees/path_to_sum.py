""" 
Path to sum

Reference: https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

Example: 

#           5
#         /   \
#        4     8
#       /      / \
#      11    13   4
#     /  \          \
#    7    2          1
    
path: 5 -> 4 -> 11 -> 2 = 22; Return True
