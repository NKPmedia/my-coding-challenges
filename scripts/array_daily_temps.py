Daily Temperatures

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/

Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures 

```
T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
```

Output should be:

```
[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each
temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

Note: a stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which
the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out)

Solution: Monotonic Decreasing Stack
Time complexity: O(n)
