Subsets

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/

Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible subsets
(the power set). 

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any
order. 

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]

Solutions: DFS
Time Complexity: O(n * 2^n)
