Splitting a String Into Descending Consecutive Values

Reference:
https://leetcode.com/problems/splitting-a-string-into-descending-consecutive-values/

You are given a string s that consists of only digits.

Check if we can split s into two or more non-empty substrings such that the
numerical values of the substrings are in descending order and the difference
between numerical values of every two adjacent substrings is equal to 1.

Example: 
Input: s = "1234"
Output: false
Explanation: There is no valid way to split s.

Input: s = "050043"
Output: true
Explanation: s can be split into ["05", "004", "3"] with numerical values [5,4,3].
The values are in descending order with adjacent values differing by 1.

Solution: Backtracking (brute force approach)
We check each possible path in the tree and see if any of the paths work out where the difference between adjacent values is 1.
