Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II

Refer to: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/

Given the root of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of
its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to
root).

Example:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[15,7],[9,20],[3]]

#       3
#     /  \ 
#    9   20             
#        / \
#       15  7      
                          
Solution: Breadth First Search w/ a Queue. We will start from the root node
perform a level order traversal while maintaining two queues. One queue will be
used for iterating over each node at a given level, and another queue (e.g. double-ended queue) for
pushing the visited level to a queue; this way the last level visited will be
the first element in the results array.
Time Complexity: O(n)
