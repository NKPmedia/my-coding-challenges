# Coding Challenges

This repo contains my solutions to some LeetCode and HackerRank challenges in
addition to scripts covering various data structures/algorithms written in
Python. The repo will be periodically updated with more examples over time
covering the following problem types:

- Arrays
- Binary Search
- Binary Trees
- N-Ary Trees
- Backtracking 
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Dynamic Programming
- Hashmap
- Heaps 
- Linked List
- Matrix
- Probability
- Queue 
- Stacks
- Sort 
- Strings
