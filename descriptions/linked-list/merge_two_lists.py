Merge Two Sorted Lists

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:
Input: 
l1 = [1,2,4]
l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: 
results = [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Example
List_1 = [1,3,5,10,15]
List_2 = [-1,2,3,4]
Output = [-1,1,2,3,3,4,5,10,15]

Solution: Linked List
Time Complexity: O(n)
