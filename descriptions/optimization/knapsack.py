Fractional Knapsack problem

Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fractional-knapsack-problem/

Given weights and values (or profits) of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack
of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

Example:
inputs:
weights = [2, 3, 5, 7, 1, 4, 1]
profit = [10, 5, 15, 7, 6, 18, 3]
capacity = 15
output: 55.333    

Solution: Greedy Algorithm
Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
