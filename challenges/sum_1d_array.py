## Running Sum of 1d Array

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]). Return the running sum of nums.

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
```
