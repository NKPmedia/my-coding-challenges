# Python Coding Challenges

This repo contains my solutions to some LeetCode and HackerRank challenges
written in Python. The repo will be periodically updated with more examples
over time covering the following problem types:

- Arrays
- Binary Search
- Binary Trees
- Dynamic Programming
- Hashmap
- Linked List
- Matrix
- Probability
- Queue
- Recurison
- Sort
- Stacks
- Strings

resources which helped gain a deep understanding of data structures/algorithms
and other general Python fundamentals.

## Machine Learning

In addition to Python coding challenges (e.g. data structures and algoirthms), the 
`machinelearning` notebook covers implementing - Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, 
Deep Learning (MLP), and Singular Value Decomposition from scratch.
