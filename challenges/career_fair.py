## University Career Fair (Twitter)

Sam is part of the organizing team arranging the university's career fair and has a list of companies and their respective arrival times and durations. Due to the university-wide budget cuts, there is only one stage available on the entire campus so only one event can occur at a time. Given each company's arrival time and the duration they will stay, determine the max number of events that can be hosted during the fair.

For example, there are `n=5` companies that will arrive at times `arrival = [1,3,3,5,7]` and will stay for `duration = [2,2,1,2,1]`. The first company arrives at `time=1` and stays for `2 hours`. At `time=3`, two companies arrive, but only 1 can stay for either `1` or `2` hours. The next companies arrive at `time=5` and `time=7` and do not conflict with each other. In total, there can be a max of `4` events. 

Complete the `maxEvents` function below. It must return an integer with the max number of events that can be hosted. `maxEvents` has the following inputs:

- `arrival[arrival[0]....arrival[n-1]]`: an array of ints where ith element is the arrival time of the ith company.
- `duration[duration[0]...duration[n-1]]`: an array of the integers where ith element is the duration that the ith company stays at the career fair.
