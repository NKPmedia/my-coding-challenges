Detect Squares

Reference: https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-squares/

You are given a stream of points on the X-Y plane. Design an algorithm that:

Adds new points from the stream into a data structure. Duplicate points are
allowed and should be treated as different points. 
Given a query point, counts the number of ways to choose three points from the
data structure such that the three points and the query point form an
axis-aligned square with positive area. 
An axis-aligned square is a square whose edges are all the same length and are
either parallel or perpendicular to the x-axis and y-axis. 

Implement the DetectSquares class:

DetectSquares() Initializes the object with an empty data structure.
void add(int[] point) Adds a new point point = [x, y] to the data structure.
int count(int[] point) Counts the number of ways to form axis-aligned squares
with point point = [x, y] as described above

Solution: Using a hashmap to store the points and find diagonal points. 
Time Complexity: O(1)
