Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
 
Reference:  https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
 
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

Tree:
                     3
                   /   \
                  9    20 
                       / \
                      15  7

Solution: Breath first search
Time Complexity: O(n)
Memory Complexity: O(n)
