Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path
from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example:
# 	     3 
# 	   /   \
#     9    20 
#          / \
# 	  	15  7

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output = 3

Solution: Binary Tree
Time Complexity: O(n); in the worst case when the tree becomes unbalanced.
